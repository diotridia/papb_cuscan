    <string name="borobudur1">Borobudur Temple is the largest Buddhist temple in the world. Built in
        the 9th century, Borobudur Temple is now a magnet that can attract millions of tourists every year.</string>
    <string name="borobudur2">Based on the Karangtengah inscription, it is estimated that the Borobudur Temple was built by King Samaratungga of Wangsa Syailendra and had just been completed by his daughter, Ratu Pramudawardhani, in the 9th century.

Little is known about anything else, including who the architect of the building is made up of 2 million beams (55,000 m3) of andesite which interlock like a giant puzzle.

A Javanese legend tells of Gunadarma who lay looking at Borobudur Temple until he fell asleep and his body turned into Menoreh hills. Gunadarma was later considered the architect of the Borobudur Temple even though there were no historic inscriptions about it.</string>
